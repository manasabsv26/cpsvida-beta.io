  description: Jyotirmoy V. Deshmukh is an Assoc. Professor at the Department of Computer Science and co-director for Center for Autonomy and AI (with link). He transitioned to this position after five years of work as a Principal Research Engineer at Toyota Motors North America R&D. Before joining Toyota, he was the 2010 Computing Innovation Post-Doctoral Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania under the mentorship of Rajeev Alur. He got his Ph.D. in computer engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 2010, where he was advised by E. Allen Emerson. His current research interests include the application of formal methods to reason about cyber-physical systems, verification and testing of embedded control systems, real-time temporal logics, and analyzing time-series data. He is particularly interested in studying cyber-physical systems that use machine learning based components.
